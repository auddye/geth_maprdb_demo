    "# Geth Transactions into MaprDB JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the flow to pull the Ethereum Blockchain through a local geth client (running in a docker container), perform light transformations to obtain valid JSON transaction records, and push the data into an existing Mapr-DB cluster (using the data-access-gateway RESTful iterface). While the data loads, an second notebook will use the REST api to send a query to MapR-DB, and retrieve selected attributes of \"interesting\" transactions (for example, those whose creators significantly overpaid to prioritize) for further analysis.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Before you begin\n",
    "For best results, this jupyter server should be running in a docker container (as testuser, with preconfigured python environment), from on an \"edge node\"* of a secured MapR6.0.1-MEP5.0.0 cluster. In addition: \n",
    "- geth client must be connected to its peers & accessible over private IP (replace 172.16.9.41 with your own IP)\n",
    "- testuser should exist on all nodes, and have a home directory on mfs where it can create the maprdb table\n",
    "- one or more maprdb rest gateways should be accessible over private IP (replace 172.16.9.42 and 172.16.9.238)\n",
    "- mapr cluster must be alive and stay alive - might want to keep an eye on it during the load\n",
    "\n",
    "*An \"edge node\" here means a linux host (i'm using centos7.4) capable of running docker containers, and no special MapR packages or configurations required. This notebook can be optionally securely persisted to MapR-FS, by starting this docker container with a volume mount on top of a mapr-loopbacknfs client (on the underlying host) using testuser's mapr ticket, but this is not required for the demo.\n"
